Anomaly Detection: Attention-Fusion & Transformer-VAE
This repository features an advanced multi-stage machine learning pipeline developed to detect security attacks by synthesizing unsupervised outlier detection with deep latent feature extraction. The system is specifically optimized for Identity Compromise detection as part of the ISR Labs Bootcamp.

🚀 Methodology & Architecture
The pipeline follows a hybrid architecture designed to maximize detection precision while minimizing false positives:

1. Latent Feature Extraction
Raw data is processed through a Patch-Transformer Variational Autoencoder (VAE). This stage projects high-dimensional tabular data into a 32-dimensional latent space, capturing complex non-linear dependencies and structural "normalcy".

2. Unsupervised Ensemble
Three industry-standard outlier detection models are trained on the extracted latent features to generate independent anomaly scores:

Isolation Forest: Detects isolation-based outliers.

One-Class SVM: Identifies boundary-based deviations.

Local Outlier Factor (LOF): Evaluates local density deviations.

3. Attention-Based Fusion
The final decision layer is a PyTorch-based Attention-Only Fusion model. It utilizes a Multi-head Attention mechanism to dynamically weight and aggregate scores from the ensemble into a final supervised prediction.

📊 Performance Benchmark
The Decoders team achieved high-fidelity results on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of the attention-fusion approach:

Metric	Score
Accuracy	99.07%
Precision	91.13%
F1-Score	0.8248
ROC-AUC	0.9961
🛠️ Implementation Highlights
Mixed-Type Preprocessing: Seamlessly handles numeric features via RobustScaler and categorical features via OneHotEncoder.

Optimal Thresholding: Decision boundaries are automatically tuned on validation data to maximize the F1-score.

Overfitting Protection: Both the VAE and Fusion training loops implement Early Stopping based on validation loss.
